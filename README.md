This is a simple ToDo app built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows you to create a list of tasks that you need to complete and mark them as done when you're finished.

## Features

- Create new tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed)
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Kuroe27/React-Todo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
